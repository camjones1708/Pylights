Repository for raspberry pi spectrum analyser sent from pc

Uses this library https://github.com/fishkingsin/elinux-lpd8806/

Project was started by Paul Dunn on here https://code.google.com/p/pc-pi-lightshow/

I also used https://learn.adafruit.com/downloads/pdf/raspberry-pi-spectrum-analyzer-display-on-rgb-led-strip.pdf
by Scott Driscoll as a large reference and a lot of material of the lightshowpi community.

Credit to Sean Millar, Todd Giles, and Chris Usey as well for their lightshowpi work.
